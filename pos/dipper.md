\- Sync latest sources  
\- Add MiCam (Portrait mode doesn't work; it seems to be an issue on the ROM source side. You need to format data if the camera keeps crashing. TIP: Go to settings>customize>feature layout> drag portrait from start screen.)  
\- IMPORTANT!! You might have an assert error while updating, if you got this error, you need to do some workarounds.  
\- Reboot to fastbootd, fastboot delete-logical-partition scratch, fastboot delete-logical-partition product, reboot into recovery mode, and then flash the zip
